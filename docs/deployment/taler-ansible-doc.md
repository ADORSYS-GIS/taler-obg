# GNU Taler Ansible Script Documentation

## 1. Purpose of Ansible in GNU Taler

Ansible is used in the GNU Taler ecosystem to automate the deployment, configuration, and maintenance of the infrastructure. By leveraging Ansible, GNU Taler ensures:

- **Consistency** in deployments across environments.
- **Automation** of routine administrative and security tasks.
- **Scalability** to manage multiple hosts efficiently.
- **Security & Compliance** through automated checks and updates.

## 2. Overview of Key Components

### Inventories

An **Inventory** is a file that lists the servers (or nodes) that Ansible manages. The `inventories` directory defines different environments (Staging and Production). Each inventory file:

- Lists the hosts for the respective environment.
- Includes SSH connection details.
- Allows Ansible to target specific environments during playbook execution.

### Playbooks

A **Playbook** in Ansible is a YAML file that contains a set of tasks to be executed on remote servers. It defines the steps required to:

- Configure systems.
- Deploy applications.
- Automate repetitive tasks.

The `playbooks` directory contains Ansible playbooks for **deployment, configuration, and maintenance** of the GNU Taler system.

#### Key Playbooks:

##### Infrastructure Setup:
- `setup.yml` – Configures the full Taler infrastructure, including web servers, databases, and monitoring tools.

##### Financial Transactions:
- `libuefin-export.yml` & `libuefin-import.yml` – Manage transaction processing through Libeufin.
- `sanctionlist-check.yml` – Imports compliance and sanction lists.

##### Backup & Security:
- `borg-ssh-export.yml` & `pixel-borg.yml` – Handle encrypted data backups.
- `test-secrets.yml` – Ensures secure credential handling.

##### Configuration & Monitoring:
- `tops-public.yml` – Defines system-wide configuration settings.
- PostgreSQL, Nginx, and Prometheus integration for operational reliability.

These playbooks, leveraging Ansible roles, ensure **secure and repeatable deployments** while maintaining compliance standards.

### Roles

A **Role** is a modular and reusable collection of Ansible tasks, handlers, variables, and templates that focus on a specific function, such as:

- Setting up a database.
- Configuring a web server.
- Managing security settings.

The `roles` directory contains modular components for **deployment, security, monitoring, and maintenance**.

#### Role Categories:

##### Core Infrastructure:
- `database` – Configures PostgreSQL.
- `webserver` – Sets up Nginx for hosting Taler services.
- `common_packages` – Ensures required dependencies are installed.

##### Taler Services:
- `exchange` – Deploys the Taler Exchange service.
- `auditor` – Manages the auditing system.
- `challenger` – Configures verification challengers (email, SMS, postal authentication).

##### Backup & Security:
- `borg-ssh-export`, `borg-start`, `pixel-borg` – Manage secure backups.
- `exchange-sanctionlist-import` – Ensures compliance by importing restricted entity lists.

##### Automation & Monitoring:
- `ansible-pull` – Enables automated configuration updates.
- `monitoring` – Integrates Prometheus and Grafana for observability.

##### Financial Transaction Handling:
- `libeufin-nexus`, `libeufin-transaction-export`, `libeufin-transaction-import` – Manage financial transaction processing via Libeufin.

These roles provide a **robust and scalable deployment strategy**, ensuring security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

## 3. Deployment & Configuration Strategy

The deployment process follows a **structured Ansible-based automation approach**, covering:

### Core Deployment:
- ✅ `deploy.sh` – Automates the full system deployment.

### Financial Operations:
- ✅ `libeufin-export.sh`, `import.sh` – Handle financial data exports and imports.

### Backup & Security:
- ✅ `extract-borg-key.sh`, `setup-pixel-borg.sh`, `start-borg-backups.sh` – Ensure secure and encrypted backups.

### Compliance Enforcement:
- ✅ `sanction-check.sh` – Validates compliance requirements.

### Financial System Setup:
- ✅ `test-activate.sh`, `test-offline.conf` – Configure test and offline environments.

### Testing & Development:
- ✅ `test.sh` – Provides a testing framework for development and deployment validation.

This structured approach guarantees **security, compliance, and automation efficiency** throughout the deployment lifecycle.

## 4. Technologies Used

The GNU Taler Ansible infrastructure utilizes the following technologies:

- **Podman** – Container management.
- **Ansible** – Infrastructure automation.
- **Bash & Shell Scripts** – System-level scripting.
- **Borg (BorgBackup & Pixel Borg)** – Secure backup solutions.
- **Taler Exchange** – Financial transaction handling.

This technology stack ensures **reliable, automated, and secure financial operations** within the GNU Taler ecosystem.
