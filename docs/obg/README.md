# OBG APIs and Workflows Documentation

This document provides an overview of the OBG system's APIs and workflows. It serves as the central reference for understanding how the OBG components interact, the available endpoints, authentication requirements, and the typical flows used within the system. This documentation is intended for developers, integrators, and contributors looking to extend or integrate with OBG.

## 1. Overview

The OBG (Open Banking Gateway) project provides a set of APIs and workflows designed to facilitate secure and efficient banking integrations. The key objectives are:

- **API Integration:**  
  Expose a robust set of APIs for banking operations, including Payment Initiation, Consent Management, and Account Information.
  
- **Workflow Automation:**  
  Streamline processes such as wallet top-ups and account verification using standardized banking workflows.

- **Security and Compliance:**  
  Ensure strong customer authentication (SCA) and adherence to regulatory standards (e.g., PSD2).

## 2. Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

- **Components:**  
  - **Backend Services:** Core logic for processing API requests and managing banking workflows.
  - **API Gateway:** Serves as the entry point for client requests, handling routing and load balancing.
  - **Authentication Service:** Manages SCA and token-based authentication.
  - **Adapter Layer:** Integrates with various European banks and handles specific API adaptations.
  
- **Data Flow:**  
  1. **Client Request:** Initiates a transaction or queries account information.
  2. **Authentication:** Request is validated using SCA methods.
  3. **Processing:** The request is processed through the backend and routed via the API Gateway.
  4. **Response:** Data is returned, or actions are performed, and the workflow is updated accordingly.

For a detailed architectural diagram, please refer to [Architecture Diagram](architecture.md).

## 3. API Endpoints

### Common Endpoints

- **Payment Initiation:**  
  `/api/payments/initiate`  
  _Description:_ Initiates a payment request using the OBG FinTech API.  
  _Method:_ POST  
  _Parameters:_ Payment details, authentication tokens.

- **Consent Management:**  
  `/api/consents`  
  _Description:_ Manages user consents for data access and transaction approvals.  
  _Method:_ GET/POST  
  _Parameters:_ Consent ID, user information.

- **Account Information:**  
  `/api/accounts`  
  _Description:_ Retrieves account information and transaction history.  
  _Method:_ GET  
  _Parameters:_ Account ID, date ranges, filters.

### Detailed API Documentation

For each endpoint, include:
- **Request Format:** Sample JSON payload.
- **Response Format:** Example responses.
- **Error Codes:** Common error responses and troubleshooting steps.

(Additional endpoint details should be added as they are documented.)

## 4. Authentication & Security

- **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA):**  
  Details on the SCA approaches supported by OBG, including multi-factor authentication processes.
  
- **Token-Based Authentication:**  
  How OAuth2 or similar protocols are implemented within OBG.
  
- **Security Best Practices:**  
  Recommendations for secure API usage, error handling, and logging.

For further details, see [Security Guidelines](security.md) (if available).

## 5. Workflows

### Payment Workflow

1. **Initiation:**  
   A client initiates a payment request via the `/api/payments/initiate` endpoint.
2. **Authorization:**  
   The system validates the request using SCA.
3. **Processing:**  
   The backend processes the payment, updating the wallet top-up status.
4. **Confirmation:**  
   A confirmation message is returned to the client and logged in the system.

### Consent Workflow

1. **Request Consent:**  
   A consent request is generated when a client needs to access account information.
2. **User Approval:**  
   The user approves the consent request through the client interface.
3. **Verification:**  
   The system verifies the consent and enables data access.
4. **Logging & Audit:**  
   All steps are recorded for compliance and auditing.

(Additional workflows should be detailed as required.)
