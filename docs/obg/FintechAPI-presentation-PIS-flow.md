# FintechAPI PIS flow Documentation

## 1. Overview
  
  This document provides details on how Fintech API is used in the Payment Initiation Flow
---

## 2. Understanding the Payment Initiation Service in XS2A

The Payment Initiation Service (PIS) in XS2A (Access to Account) allows third-party providers (TPPs) to initiate payments on behalf of a user directly from their bank account.  

### Key Components in XS2A Payment Initiation:

- **Fintech**:  
  Entity that provides an app (mobile/web) to the PSU for them to initiate the payment (note that in some cases, the Fintech can also be the TPP).
- **TPP (Third-Party Provider)**:  
  A licensed entity that interacts with the bank's API to initiate payments.
- **PSU (Payment Service User)**:  
  The end-user who initiates the payment via a fintech/TPP app.
- **ASPSP (Account Servicing Payment Service Provider)**:  
  The bank or financial institution holding the payerâ€™s account.
- **SCA (Strong Customer Authentication)**:  
  A security mechanism required for user authentication.

## 3. API Description

 - **Overview**: This API provides Fintechs with the capability to perform payment initiation calls to the PSU's bank.To communicate with the OpenBankingGateway a fintech UI need to communicate with a fintechAPI on the fintechServer side that will forwards the request to the OPG API described [here]([https://github.com/adorsys/open-banking-gateway/blob/develop/opba-banking-rest-api-ymls/src/main/resources/static/tpp_banking_api_ais.yml](https://github.com/ADORSYS-GIS/taler-obg/blob/main/docs/obg/Open%20Banking%20Gateway%20-%20PIS%20Flow%20Documentation.md)).
 - **Consumers**: FintechUI   
Let see some of the endpoints related to the PIS flow that we are having :  

### a. FinTechAuthorization 

#### i. **POST v1/login**

Simple login interface used to establish a session between PSU and FinTech. Real application will delegate login to an oAuth2 Identity provider.

**- Request Header:**

- `X-Request-ID `: Unique ID that identifies this request through common workflow. Must be contained in HTTP Response as well..

**- Request Body:**

- `Login request`: Just a combination of the username and the password  
Example value  
```
{ "username":"string"
  "password": "string"
}
```

**- Response Header:**

- `X-Request-ID`: Unique ID that identifies this request.
- `Set-Cookie`: SessionCookie used to maintain the login session between the FinTechUI and the FinTechApi. This cookie is validated using an X-XSRF-TOKEN sent with the request header. This cookie must contain a hash reference to the corresponding XSRF-TOKEN -> hash(XSRF-TOKEN). So in order to verify that the request originate from the FinTechUI application, a server component will hash the given XSRF-TOKEN and compare it with the result in the cookie.
Remember that the XSRF-TOKEN value must be extracted from the request parameter named X-XSRF-TOKEN and not from a cookie header. This is important to mention as some implementation might return the XSRF-TOKEN to the FinTechUI in form of a cookie.  
- `X-XSRF-TOKEN`: XSRF parameter used to validate a SessionCookie. This token is produced by the FinTechAPI by either Storing a hash value of the XSRF-TOKEN in the SessionCookie or
Using the XSRF-TOKEN to encrypt the content of the SessionCookie. The XSRF-TOKEN is returned to the FinTechUI as a response header with the header value X-XSRF-TOKEN. It is the responsibility of the FinTechUI will take care of ensuring the persistence of the XSRF-TOKEN.  

**- Response body:**

- `200 code`: The user profile object. Contains information needed to present some sort of dashboard to the user.
  ```
    {
  "userProfile": {
    "name": "string",
    "lastLogin": "2025-03-21T09:18:56.963Z"
  }
  }
  ```
- `401 code`: Access credentials absent or invalid. This happens when

  - Provided credential for login not matching.
  - Endpoint expect a session cookie but none is present.
  - Session cookie is present but associated stateString does not match.  
As a consequence, we reset existing FinTechLoginSessionState if any. Nevertheless we do not reset RedirectSessionCookie.
```

So in order to verify that the request originate from the FinTechUI application, a server component will hash the given XSRF-TOKEN and compare it with the result in the cookie.
Remember that the XSRF-TOKEN value must be extracted from the request parameter named X-XSRF-TOKEN and not from a cookie header. This is important to mention as some implementation might return the XSRF-TOKEN to the FinTechUI in form of a cookie.

Using the XSRF-TOKEN to encrypt the content of the SessionCookie. The XSRF-TOKEN is returned to the FinTechUI as a response header with the header value X-XSRF-TOKEN. It is the responsibility of the FinTechUI will take care of ensuring the persistence of the XSRF-TOKEN.
**- Response Body:**

For detailed explanation about our APIs you can check those files:

## 5. Authentication

Here we are using what we call SCA Approaches to ensure that the PSU is really the one that want to initiate the payment in our scenario. **SCA** stands for Strong Customer Authentication. In general we have 3 SCA approaches:
 - **Embedded approach**: When using the embedded approach, during the payment initiation transaction the PSU will his bank personal security credentials on the TPP/Fintech screen.
 - **Redirect approach**: When using this approach, the PSU will be redirect on the bank's side (e.g Online banking app) to enter his credentials and confirm the payment
 - **Decoupled approach**: Here the PSU will be sent to a separate secondary devince to authenticate during the payment initiation transaction

Those authentication mecanisms are managed inside the Online Banking Gateway project using the **[ConsentAuthorisationApi](#ConsentAuthorisationApi)**

---

## 6. Architecture and workflow

So in this section we will show a simplified architecture of the Open Banking Gateway and explain the workflow when it is come to Payment Initiation Service

![OBG architecture](img/fintech_OBG.png "Architecture").

In this picture all the green components represent a fintech application use by the PSU to initiate the payment.
In our scenario using our fintech-example when the PSU want to initiate a payment that is what is happening
- S1: On the fintech app the PSU will search and select his bank with a call that will go though the fintech API and reach the TPPBankSearchApi on the TPP side (our OBG API)
- 1a: The PSU will initiate a payment on the Fintech UI by providing all the informations we need to have (IBAN,instructed amount,etc...)
- 1b: The Fintech APi will carry informations gave by the PSU via the FintechAPI to the TPPBankingApi and initiate a payment via the ```/v1/banking/pis/payments/{payment-product}``` endpoint
- 1c: The OBG(on the TPP side) will go with the request to the ASPSP side
- 2a,2b,2c:  The consent authorization process is triggered by redirecting the PSU from the TppBankingApi (2a) over the FinTechApi (2b) to the ```/consent/{auth-id}``` entry point of this ConsentAuthorisationApi (2c).
- 4a,4b,4c: The final result of the authorization process is a PsuCosentSession that is returned by the token endpoint of the TppBankingAPi to the FinTechApi (4c). This handle will (PsuCosentSession) will be stored by the FinTechApi and added a PSU identifying information to each service request associated with this PSU.
